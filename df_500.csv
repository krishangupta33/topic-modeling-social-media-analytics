To give you a gist of what ReeLabs is, It is for starters the only bank in the country that has the permission to preserve Placental Stem Cells. 

The Placental Stem Cells are the richest source of stem cells and should the need arise they can help the baby in future for medical procedures. 

ReeLabs is based in Mumbai and is headed by professional doctors and scientists from India and Ukraine!

Yoga asanas can be practiced by everyone, there is no age bar as to when you should start and stop practicing this discipline.

It has umpteen benefits for the elders, it helps them to stay physically active and also supports their mental and emotional well-being.

Of course, check contra-indications, with your doctor etc before following the above but I know that your practice can be modified no matter what age you are 🤍

Knowing how to use your whole brain isn't something you're taught or necessarily know how to do in school or anywhere. 💡⁠
⁠
If you haven’t listened to our podcast episode 231: The Secret to Using Your Whole Brain with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor (less than 20 mins), I highly recommend you do so. 💡⁠
⁠
If her name sounds familiar, it's likely because you watched her TEDtalk or read her memoir, My Stroke of Insight, which we've included on our recommended book list for many years now.⁠
⁠
In this episode we’ve discussed her newest book, Whole Brain Living: The Anatomy of Choice and the Four Characters That Drive Our Lives. This book is a myth-buster in so many ways. ⚡️⁠
⁠
Listen in as Dr. Jill discusses the myths of the brain and goes into the mechanics of getting your brain to work for you. If you've ever wondered what the secret for making good choices in your life is so that you can live the life you deserve and desire, this episode is for you. 💚⁠

Doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s just required. 

Keep at it my friend. Keep adding value to others. Keeep serving. Keep believing and improving day by day. Keep treating others with kindness and respect. You’ll be surprised one day where it takes you.

Or maybe you have and you wonder what would happen if you do leave the certainty of all you’ve ever known.

Well 14 years ago I lived a typical life, working a 9-5 job and felt trapped in the rat race of working for a boss. It was a comfortable life, but deep down, I knew I was meant for something more.

One day, I took a leap of faith and decided to pursue my passion for coaching. I poured my heart and soul into building my business, determined to create transformation in the lives of many.

It wasn't easy, but with hard work and dedication, I managed to build a thriving coaching business that reached 7 figures.

As fate would have it, I was given the opportunity to feature in a documentary film called Think & Grow Rich.

It was an incredible honor to be a part of such a renowned project, and even more so, to attend the red carpet event alongside inspiring individuals like Rob Drydek, Lewis Howes, Barbara Corcoran and Bob Proctor. 

Looking back, I realize that my dreams were always within reach. It wasn't about being lucky or having connections, but about leading with service and becoming an entrepreneur that genuinely cares about making a difference in the world.

My journey is a testament to the fact that anyone can achieve their dreams if they have the courage to pursue them. It's never too late to take that leap of faith and become the person you were always meant to be. May my story inspire you to follow your heart and create the life of your dreams.

If you’d love to learn how to build a legit 7 figure coaching business online so you can work from anywhere then DM me the word ‘FREEDOM’ and let’s have a chat. I have something to share with you.

Re-connect with your body through your Yoga practice🧘🏻‍♀️ 💖

Thank you @punetimesonline, for highlighting the delicate and crucial postnatal journey of new mothers and how Yoga can be incorporated in their life to re-connect with themselves.

Breathwork, pranayama, inversions and certain asanas are what will help you to deal with pre and postpartum symptoms and bounce back to your old self.

Give this a read, we surely need more awareness when it comes to the post-natal journey of new mothers.

⁠
1️⃣ Keep your goals visible. The first page of the Full Focus Planner is designed to facilitate daily goal review. Just scanning your list on a regular basis will help you make progress; you’ll be more attuned to next steps—the small but meaningful actions that get you one step closer to achieving your goal.⁠
⁠
2️⃣ Connect to your why. To amplify that effect, review your goal motivations on a weekly basis in your Weekly Preview. Stay connected to whatever compelled you to pursue the goal in the first place. The more you can find deeply personal motivation for achievement the better.⁠
⁠
3️⃣ Pivot as necessary. What matters is the destination, not how you get there. As our CEO Megan Hyatt Miller often says, “The goal is sacred, but not the strategy.” That’s why she and our founder, Michael Hyatt, wrote their new book Mind Your Mindset. It’s practically a manual on how to pivot when you need.⁠
⁠
Your goals matter. That’s why you set them in the first place. Don’t let them die like a plant you forgot to water. Keep them visible, stay connected to your why, and change your approach until you reach your destination.⁠

Core +bent and straight arm strength of shoulders +legs all adds up to better efficiency of movement, the stronger your muscles (not necessarily bigger muscles though!) the lighter your movements.💪🏽🤸🏽‍♀️🤸🏽‍♀️🔥
.
These drills done 2 times a week alongside your practice can really help big time .
Do them for a month or 2 at least consistently to see any results.
Remember consistency is the name of the game , not jumping into every new program/ coach/ training/ trainer/ yoga teacher every few days.( the same with diets!!!!!🤪) 

NOBODY can give you the magic pill , the teacher/ coach can show you to the best of their ability , finally you HAVE to do the work.
It took me years of training any new movement/ asana/ handstand to be able to do it finally.
.
So here are the drills.
.
1️⃣Bent arm Lolasana Push/ ups : 5 reps* 3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
2️⃣Lolasana Lift-ups : 5 reps *3 sets (1 min rest between sets )
.
3️⃣Push ups (if you are advanced do them with straight legs ): 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
4️⃣L- Sits : 10 reps * 3 sets 
.
5️⃣Tolasana : 5 reps * 3 sets

⁠
Worst of all, burnout breeds cynicism. Thanks to lower productivity, it’s not like overworked employees make any real gains for their sacrifices; rather, it’s all about staying afloat in a dysfunctional work environment. This is a disaster waiting to happen if it hasn’t already. Not only does burnout hurt employees’ professional and personal lives, it breeds the kind of cynicism that sours office culture and harms customer relations. ⁠
⁠
When workers think success is zero-sum, and for the company to win, they have to lose, it’s easy to turn septic and spread toxicity through the organization and beyond. When you give your employees time and space to rest, everyone will win.⁠

The restaurant is a loud and bustling affair, complete with a vibey red glow, a 🥩 steak for $1,200 (nope, not a typo), and plenty of vape juice floating through the air 💨. As a super-fan, Antara needed to know: Could dining at Bad Bunny's restaurant make her feel connected to the musician? Would his cheeky playfulness and personality somehow shine through on the menu?

When you ask God to draw people near to you that are meant to be in your life you will start to witness incredible experiences unfold.

These moments are not just random occurrences, but instead, they hold a special meaning and purpose.

When we open ourselves up to the possibilities of what these connections can bring, we allow for a deeper understanding of our own lives and the world around us. 

Embrace the power of purposeful encounters, and see how they can shape, inspire, and uplift you.

Life is full of opportunities to connect and grow, and it's up to us to seize them with open arms and an open heart.

This space can be held by a group of like minded women/ a circle of trust but in the case where some of us are not fortunate enough to have that , we need to be the ones to “listen “ and “see” our own selves ..to create a deeper space of healing , so we do not perpetuate our ancestral wounds to the next generation, but allow our own inner child to have a safe space to express what has not been expressed..

My faves were (in order shown): Avocado 🥑 tartare (so fresh, so light, melt-in-mouth), Chicken satay (juicy, perfect and frankly the best satay I've had in a while), pork belly and the caramel-hazelnut sourdough French Toast, most of which i inhaled single handedly 🐐
Not sure why i tried to fit that pose in the last slide because my belly was bursting at the end but well here we all are :)

I've followed Michael since shortly after he launched his blog and this is hands down, the most impactful book/material I've read. This partnership between Meghan Hyatt Miller and Michael Hyatt will likely be something I return to twice a year as a cornerstone to center my mindset, particularly as I consider my goals and commitments. The beauty of this book, however, is the transformation it can have daily in course-correcting as the Narrator's voice tells me unhelpful stories. Thank you for making the time and doing the research to create such a quality book."" ⁠

Now, I help others do the same by guiding them through the transformative power of kinesthetic exercises and transformative tools combined with Faith practices.

These practices allow my clients to tap into their own inner strength and find balance in the chaos of a disconnected world.

Remember this: anxiety is not simply an external force seeking to disrupt your peace, but an internal call to action.

It's a reminder from your inner child that it's time to tend to your needs and heal past wounds.

By heeding that call, you'll discover a newfound sense of productivity and peace that replaces anxiety so that you can return back to who God created you to be.

Im excited to be launching my new online classes on sale from my website.

And there is my fav core strength drills which I did live while shooting the video and trust me had sore abs for the next few days!!!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥

I have massive respect for him for not backing down and sharing the truth of the agenda that shadowed over us the last 3 years when most buried their heads in the sand.

Isn’t it crazy how so many so called “conspiracy theories” have come true lately!?

True bravery isn't found in the absence of fear, but rather in the face of it.

It's standing firm in your beliefs, even when it means standing alone, and weathering the storm of criticism and backlash.

To all those who refuse to be silenced, who speak unapologetically in the face of adversity and stand ground when arrows fly - your courage is an inspiration to us all.

Which conspiracy theories did you end up losing followers for speaking up about which is now a fact? 👇🏼

A day to reflect on how far we’ve come. A day to start the fight against new battles. A day to #EmbraceEquity. But in between all this, let’s not forget to stretch a bit, burn a few calories, and look the best version of ourselves.

On that note, there’s a Women’s Day Sale that’s live on @reebokindia right now where you can get up to 30%-50% off. So, head there and shop your favourite gear!

I’m not much of a department store kind of shopper , always preferring the charming stand alone stores, off the beaten path. 
But Printemps has a certain je ne sais quoi which you need to see to believe. Aside from the stunning interiors and beautiful curation , they have an entire floor dedicated to vintage finds including hard to get Hermes bags and fine jewellery. They also have a space dedicated to last seasons hot pieces sold at reduced prices. If that’s not enough to sway you , they have a great personal shopper service and if you can’t make it to the store , they have an entire set up to help make your online shopping experience personalised and seem less. 
Wow, I just realised I literally went on a rant but I truly was very impressed.

The fashion cycle is constant but there are still moments that ground us in artistry and tradition. The Gucci Jackie 1961 bag is one such moment.
 
A key design of The House for decades, the Jackie has been reimagined several times over the years. Its newest incarnation, the #GucciJackie1961, beholds the Jackie story, but with a new perspective. An emblematic bag known for its half-moon shape, pared-down silhouette, and sleek piston hardware now carries itself with a non-binary attitude, transcending social constructs and time itself.

The Jackie 1961 boldly takes on any outfit, perfect for any occasion with its timeless elegance. To me, the Gucci Jackie 1961 bag represents an identity that is always growing but nevertheless stays connected to the core of its beauty.

Through prayer and faith, I learned to trust in His love and provision, and found peace that transcends all understanding.

Whether you're a believer or not, know that you don't have to face anxiety alone.

God reminds us that we don’t need to control everything.

Stress is ‘Fear of Loss of Control’ and it is the reason why we stay on loop because we want certainty to feel safe.

But this is an illusion most of the time.

Call upon God in prayer to give you clarity and your steps will not be confusing but will be paced and more clear.

Take heart in the truth that God's love is available to all, and that He is always with you, ready to support and guide you through any struggle.

Have you ever experienced peace with God before?

The book is an autobiographical account of the author which just like the title suggest is a story of faith and miracles right from the day the author was to be born. I have known the author for a while and have read other books penned by him but was unaware of his journey (personal journey). Had a wide view of his professional journey and the to an extent about his spiritual journey but got a macro view how faith, prayers and miracles have guided him right from the start and how they have made him professionally and personally achieve much more. I won’t spoil the book by letting out the details but trust me this book will make you believe in faith and miracle.

These shirts are super high quality, very comfortable, and fit great. Thomas is wearing a medium in these photos, but he often prefers a large because they shrink a tiny bit in the wash.

Highlights:

6.5L Naturally Aspirated V12 paired with three electric motors (2 front, 1 rear) that altogether make 1,001 Horsepower.

Redline is 9,500 RPM.

AWD.

New in-house developed transverse 8-speed dual clutch.

2.5 seconds to 60. 217 mph top speed.

Battery can recharge fully in 6 minutes from driving (regenerative braking and the V12)

New Citta (City) mode, which is EV only and has 6 miles of range.

Lighter and stiffer frame than the aventador but dry weight is still about 500 lbs more despite a carbon monocoque.

At first glance, it looks like they’ve thrown everything at this. And the plugin stuff would scare us if it didn’t work so extraordinarily well in the 296 Ferrari we just tested. Pluck my butt hair and call me Sally because we’re ready for this new almost 4,000 lbs Italian monster, are you?

The ones who let go,
The ones who hold on ..

To a place where we can just be. 
Where the water is clear and skies are bright,
Where we can see the stars shine through the night ⭐️

A place we can let our heart and soul shine, 
Where we can leave the worldly cage behind. 
A place where we live our dreams, and don’t have to plan, 
Where nothing is more or less than. 

We can use our wings and learn to fly, 
With no one to judge and ask us why. 
We’ll find ourselves as we lose our way, 
Let’s be at a place where our hearts will be free as the winds blowing each day.

On International Women’s Day 2023, introducing our Digital Cover Star Tahira Kashyap Khurrana! 
 
@tahirakashyap is a force to reckon with. She's bold, unfiltered, unapologetic and has created an identity of her own. Her nuanced writing and empowering women-centric stories make her the perfect fit for our Women’s Day special digital cover.
 
The filmmaker confesses how she didn’t indulge in self-love for the longest time and used to look down upon herself, “For me that was being narcissist, but there’s a huge difference between self-love and narcissism. Self-love is truly constructive, while narcissism is very destructive.”

So after years of experiencing this and also coaching people through the process of identifying it and healing from it, this is gaslighting in a nutshell…

Gaslighting is when someone often tries to manipulate you and make you doubt your own perception of reality.

The gaslighter tries to control you and make you feel powerless, which can be really confusing and upsetting.

The person who is gaslighting you may have gone through some tough stuff in their own life. 

Maybe they were hurt, neglected or abused when they were younger, and that pain is still with them.

But instead of dealing with it, they take it out on others.

It's not your job to fix their problems, but it might help you understand that they are hurting too. 

That doesn't excuse their behavior, but it might help you feel less angry or ashamed.

You can still protect yourself, set boundaries and find support to heal from the gaslighting.

None of us are perfect and we all slip into a form of gaslighting at some point in our life but when it is not attended to or is a constant go-to tactic in relationship it can be extremely selfish and manipulative.

Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness. You have the right to trust your own experiences and feelings.

Don't let the gaslighter dim your light or make you feel crazy. You are not alone, and you can heal from this.

Have you experienced gaslighting from someone close to you?

If so what did you do to communicate to the person and/or heal from the after effects of it?

I was invited by the @isha.foundation and had the privilege to experience and learn their simple but effective way of living. 

I also had the chance to meet and interact with @sadhguru and it was definitely spiritually elevating for my soul and outlook towards life. 

I was definitely overwhelmed mesmerised by the magnanimous AdiYogi statue, the story the light show conveyed, meeting the students @ishahomeschool, meditating at the dhyanalinga, every little thing was just pure joy. 

Shared this experience not only with my mom, the other beautiful souls but also got lucky meeting one of my bestest @jaiswalpragya 🖤

If you neglect them, the weeds of misunderstandings, miscommunications, and mistrust can quickly take hold, and before you know it, the beautiful relationship you once had can become overrun with negativity.

But just as a garden can be restored to its former glory with a little bit of TLC, relationships can be salvaged as well. The key is to recognize the warning signs of neglect and address them before they have a chance to grow.

Nurturing a relationship means actively showing your appreciation and affection for the other person.

And finally, attention is crucial for any relationship to thrive. This means being present in the moment and actively listening when the other person speaks. It means putting aside distractions like phones or work, and really focusing on the person in front of you.

Giving your full attention to your loved ones lets them know that they are valued and respected, and that their thoughts and feelings are important to you.

Interrogate them, then reimagine how you would state a more positive story.⁠
⁠
Start small. Begin using “get to” rather than “have to,” for instance. This might require some practice and a little persistence. ⁠
⁠
For example, replace “I have to go to work.” with, “I get to go to work.”⁠

Here’s what I will be upto in a snapshot in 2023:

- Soak in the morning sun every morning 🌞
Let the warmth embrace you as you start your day with yourself by yourself

- My Pranayama is my everything 🌬️
Breath work centres you, brings you back to yourself and gets you ready for the day

- Meditate everyday 🧘🏻‍♀️
Start simple with even 5 minutes, work your way up and feel the magic ✨

- Hydrateeee!!!!! 💧
Your water intake truly makes such a big difference in the way you feel 

- Be kinder to myself 💌
The narrative your adopt to talk yourself matters, make sure its a positive one

- Keeping loving myself ❤️
Love truly makes the world go round and it starts with loving yourself first

So, What are you challenge yourself with in 2023? Let me know in your comments and share with everyone you know 🖤

Consider that the Mirai is a California-only model and suddenly that ‘Limited’ badge on the trunk means more than just the $66,000+ price tag.

Filling it up is like filling it up with gas, except you have to do it at hydrogen stations which are few and far between (once you’ve waited behind the other Mirai owners, see photo). It then operates like an EV. In essence, this feels like a fat 4,300 lb electric Camry except it powers the rear wheels and rides softer. Make no mistake, It’s an incredibly pleasant companion.

The 300 lb ft of torque is immediate and smooth, although the 182 hp means that past the initial push it chills out HARD, achieving a 9+ second 0-60. It wins traffic lights, not quarter miles. I’ve included a video.

The cabin, despite the vehicle’s length (same as a BMW 5 Series) is surprisingly modest in size. The trunk isn’t huge either. But like the Crown we just tested, it feels lexus-lite, although a smidge last gen. Plush seats, nice materials. And a JBL sound system that ACTUALLY has some bass. The new Prius, the Corollas and the Crown would like to share some of that please.

It was $108 to fill up at the station from almost empty. That’s supposed to give me 400 miles of range but for some reason it was showing 285. Yeah not cheap, BUT IT CLEANS THE AIR AS IT DRIVES. And it also pisses out the bottom when you click the H2O button. So that’s fun.

In theory, this is better than EV or ICE. It drives like an EV, which is superior in every way for a daily driver and yet you can fill it up in just a few minutes. That's the best of both worlds, no?

I googled why it isn’t more popular and got this: “The vast majority of car companies have turned away from hydrogen because of the high density of energy consumed in its production, as well as poor funding and backing from governments.”

That and I’m sure all the would-be owners don’t want to pay 70 Gs just to deal with Hindenburg jokes all day.

The Mirai is an expensive way to drive guilt-free, but if you can make it work, more power to you. (And more power to the Mirai please).

⁠
Practically speaking, most of us spend more waking time at the office than anywhere else. That means if we expect to use the Gratitude Advantage to our benefit, work is actually the best place to do it. ⁠
⁠
And as a leader, it’s important to remember that people will only go so far in the performance of a duty. They will underperform when they feel underappreciated.⁠
⁠
If you want people’s very best, you have to have their hearts. You can’t demand this or even buy it with a paycheck. Gratitude is the most effective currency for keeping people engaged and performing at their best. That’s true for you and the people you lead.⁠

I have read books penned by the author in the past and I must say he is one of my few favourite authors when it comes to reading this genre. He can hook you right from the very first page of his book. It’s happened with me in the past and it’s the same feeling right now while I was reading “The Highway Murders”. The book is based on a true story of a psycho killer named M Jaishankar. The story is breathtaking and can be read in a sitting or two but I took my time as the details are gory and I needed my break time from part or part. The author as usual has very very well researched the topic and written the story in a way that it catches your eye and mind from the cover right UPTO the end. It’s a fascinating true story which I would recommend all to read who like this genre it’s got the facts but it still doesn’t sound academic. It’s gruesome but very intriguing. So happy thrill reading this weekend

When you have a car for a week, sometimes it starts great and then it does things that make you a little colder on it. This was the opposite, I warmed to the RX over time. But not completely.

The good: It hustles. The last two cars I had this month (Mirai, Highlander) were both 9 seconds to 60, so the sub 6 second time of the RX500h felt like lightspeed. And it has a hybrid FOUR cylinder! One that makes, wait for it…

366 hp and 406 lb ft. That’s about as good as it gets for a 4-cyl this side of an AMG. It feels genuinely quick and doesn’t sound bad doing it either. The powertrain, ahead of cabin isolation, is by far the highlight of this car. Matched nicely to the six-speed transmission, it is both smooth and effective.

We said the Highlander and the Crown feel lexus-like in the cabin and you know what, the Toyotas are definitely nipping at the heels of Lexus quality now. This isn’t a huge step up and in fact the roof had a constant creak that I wasn’t able to diagnose.

The seats are great and the Mark Levinson audio is superior to anything in a Toyota but some things are a step backward. I don’t mind the bigger screen but toggling between carplay and the native app is completely unintuitive. Also, modifying the cluster requires getting to second base with the steering wheel touch buttons while looking at the head up display to see what menu you’re changing [video in carousel]. A seemingly complex and unnecessary way to “get one over” on a Toyota.

It handles its 4,750 lb weight pretty well but it feels heavy in the corners. The Highlander felt more spry even with the third row.

Styling may sell you on this Copper Crest coloured RX. And really it IS rather nice, but at 90K CAD as specced, it's expensive. The Germans and the Genesis stuff are stiff competition at that price. Given the choice, I’d stick this powertrain in the Highlander and call it a day, even if that made the Highlander $10k more. But if that was possible, Lexus wouldn’t exist now would it?

Our relationship was a mere blip on the radar, lasting just three months. Thankfully, I had enough know-how in coaching and self-awareness to cut my losses and start healing.

But the poor guy who followed in my footsteps? Let's just say, his experience was a world of hurt. He was left with a hefty bill and a court case to deal with.

The whole ordeal was so traumatic that he actually tracked me down for advice.

Sadly, I've heard countless stories from both men and women in recent years, describing the pain and suffering they endure at the hands of narcissistic partners.

They know they need to leave, but feel powerless and unsure of where to turn.

So I have decided to share my 6 steps that I have supported many of my coaching clients in the past with so they can build their power and confidence back up to move on from this toxic relationship that is draining them.

Again, I don’t think we should label every relationship partner ‘narcissistic’ that doesn’t work out well.

Most are other wound and trauma based patterns that play out in co-dependent relationships.

Sometimes though there are real cases of narcissistic abuse and so if you feel that you are experiencing this and want to leave then you may want to consider some of these steps.

Please share this with anyone you feel is experiencing this and needs to know ways to move forward.

Praying this helps you 🙏🏼❤️

It’s time to break free from the cycle of abuse and reclaim your power.

Leaving a narcissist is necessary for your mental and emotional well-being, personal growth, and the ability to create healthy relationships based on trust and respect.

You deserve better, take the first step towards freedom today.
